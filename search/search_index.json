Examining physiological activity helps us to understand the perception and embodied experience of cognition, emotion, motivation, and more. Additionaly, physiological data is a key component in understanding physiological sources of signal variance in fMRI data. Collecting these data helps to provide more accurate models of fMRI time-series. It also provides a real-time method to monitor subjects during scanning.

Monitoring physiology during scanning is critical to enable the characterization of a given subject's physiologic state at the time of the scan, and to track variations in physiology throughout the scan. With these data, we can more accurately model how these factors manifest in the fMRI signal time series.</p> <p>Physiological fluctuations can be identified as \"noise\" or as \"signals of interest\", depending on the research question of the imaging experiment. For most fMRI experiments, the goal is to isolate signal fluctuations that are associated with a neural stimulus and the resulting hemodynamic response (Caballero-Gaudes et al. 2016). In these data, it is important to model and remove signals with a non-neural origin, such as breathing or cardiac related signal variance. Removing these confounds will improve the sensitivity and confidence of the fMRI analysis. In some fMRI experiments, the goal is to characterize a physiologic effect (for example, studies that map cerebrovascular reactivity aim to quantify the dilation of blood vessels during certain non-neural stimuli) (Caballero-Gaudes et al. 2016). In these studies it is essential that the relevant physiologic parameters are recorded so that the analysis produces robust, quantitative physiological parameter maps.</p> <p>Another benefit of collecting physiological data is that it provides a method to monitor the subject and/or patient during the scan in real-time. Any sudden changes in the different aspects being monitored can help those in the control room identify if the person is under duress or complying with the scan protocol. Looking out for these changes is particularly helpful during an individual's first MRI scan, when they may react poorly to the scan environment. In some protocols, tracking physiology in real-time can ensure that values stay within safe, IRB-approved limits.</p> <p>Although current modeling of physiology is imperfect, and fMRI signal processing techniques do not yet accurately factor in all physiologic signals, the field continues to develop and our modeling continues to improve. We encourage all fMRI researchers to collect these data to more fully capture the variable human physiology inherent to imaging experiments.</p>"},{"location":"best_practices/#how-are-typical-physiological-data-collected","title":"How are typical physiological data collected?","text":"<p>The most common types of physiological data acquired in fMRI analysis are cardiac pulsation (pulse), breathing (chest position), and expired gas concentrations (particularly CO2 and O2).</p> <p>Cardiac pulsation can be collected via a sensor on the fingertip (or ear lobe, toe, or other pulse point). These devices are often known as a photoplethysmograph, and typically are included in the MRI scanner infrastructure. The data can thus be collected by the scanner, or recorded by a separate device. Typically the peaks of the cardiac pulsation trace are identified (e.g., the timing of each heart beat). Cardiac pulsation causes local movement artifacts, particularly around large arterial vessels, the edges of the ventricles, and in brainstem areas (Dagli et al. 1999). RETROICOR (Glover et al. 2000) is one cardiac denoising example, where the timing of each fMRI acquisition relative to the nearest cardiac peak is used to model and remove these local pulsation artifacts. Low frequency changes in heart rate have also been modeled and shown to influence the fMRI time series (Shmueli et al. 2007, Chang et al. 2009).</p> <p>Breathing is typically monitored using a \"respiratory belt\" around the participant's chest/diaphragm. The belt may be rigid or elastic, using MR compatible force or pressure transducers to generate a signal proportional to the chest diameter. The optimal positioning of the belt depends on the device being used, however it is best to be fairly consistent in how the belt is worn throughout a study. In some labs, multiple belts are used to better capture different types of breathing styles (e.g., \"chest breathing\" versus \"belly breathing\"). Often a belt is incorporated into the MRI scanner infrastructure, and these data can be collected by the scanner or recorded by a separate device. The peaks and troughs of the breathing trace are identified, which can provide information about breathing rate as well as breathing depth. There are three primary ways by which breathing can influence the fMRI signals. First, breathing often leads to bulk motion of the body and head (Brosch et al. 2002). These effects are typically modeled using volume registration and motion correction algorithms. Second, breathing changes the chest position which can influence the success of the shim, continuously changing B0 homogeneity throughout the scan and in turn affecting signal amplitude (Brosch et al. 2002, Raj et al. 2001). These effects are also modeled using techniques like RETROICOR. Thirdly, changing breathing rate and depth can influence blood gases, which can drive vasodilation or vasoconstriction, and thus substantially influence the fMRI signal amplitude (Chang and Glover 2009). RVT correction (Birn et al. 2008) estimates the change in breathing rate/depth to model these effects.</p> <p>Blood gases It is also possible (and recommended!) to directly record changes in blood gas levels, rather than infer them from a chest position measurement. Most commonly we measure carbon dioxide levels (CO2), which is a known vasodilator and can drive large variability in blood flow and the BOLD signal (Birn et al. 2006, Wise et al. 2004). We can also measure oxygen (O2) levels; O2 only has a mild vasoconstrictive effect on the cerebrovasculature, but O2 levels can directly influence BOLD signal contrast (Bulte et al. 2007). These two blood gases are typically strongly anticorrelated with each other in most scans, but can also be manipulated independently and influence the fMRI signals through distinct mechanisms (Floyd et al. 2003). Best practice would be to record both. Although the most accurate recordings of blood gas levels would be achieved through arterial sampling, this is not recommended for most imaging experiments. Instead, the concentrations of CO2 and O2 in arterial blood can be approximated by the partial pressure of each gas at the end of an exhalation, or the end-tidal partial pressure (commonly abbreviated as PETCO2 and PETO2) (Bengtsson et al. 2001, McSwain et al. 2010). The person being scanned wears a nasal cannula (soft plastic tube that rests just below the nostrils) or face mask that is connected to a gas analyzer in the control room. The resulting data shows the fluctuations in CO2 and O2 across every breath; an algorithm must extract the \"end-tidal\" values.</p>"},{"location":"best_practices/#what-equipment-is-needed","title":"What equipment is needed?","text":"<p>Peripheral devices:</p> <ul> <li>finger photoplethysmograph (pulse-oximeter)</li> <li>respiratory belt</li> <li>disposable nasal cannula (or face mask)</li> <li>long sample line to connect from the scan room to the control room</li> </ul> <p>Some peripheral devices can be passed through a void in the penetration panel from the control room to the scan room (e.g., gas sampling line); others must be plugged into the penetration panel for noise filtering (e.g., some pulse sensors). Devices native to the MRI scanner may communicate wirelessly with the scanner. When adding non-native peripheral devices to the scanner environment, we recommend that you check that you are not bringing any outside noise into the scan room or bringing too much scanner noise into the physiological recordings. It may be necessary to develop additional devices or mechanisms to shield these connections.</p> <p>Recording devices:</p> <ul> <li>CO2 and O2 analyzer</li> <li>analog-to-digital converter (ADC) or other data acquisition (DAQ)     device</li> <li>associated signal recording/analysis software</li> </ul> <p>For example, ADInstruments sells the Powerlab and uses LabChart software; Biopac sells the MP160 and uses AcqKnowledge software. It is also important to sync the physiological recordings with the fMRI scan triggers.

Phys2bids can be used to organize the various physiological data traces that you have collected.

As a sanity check, you should quickly plot each trace to ensure that it matches the type of information you think you collected.</p> <p>After this restructuring of the data, there are numerous tools available to process each type of physiological trace, identifying end-tidal values for O2 and CO2, and phases of the cardiac and respiratory cycles. These data are then further processed via smoothing or convolution to create physiological regressors, which can be incorporated into a generalized linear model framework to explain portions of your fMRI signal attributed to physiological effects.</p>"},{"location":"best_practices/#references","title":"References","text":"<p>Bengtsson, J., Bake, B., Johansson, A., &amp; Bengtson, J.

User testing are warm, human, emotional and opinionated tests that not only check that the code is doing what it needs to do, but also whether there's a better way to do it - namely better reports, clearer screen outputs, warnings and exceptions, unexpected bugs that have to be corrected.

The contribution can be a full file of data that you already acquired, a part of that file (pay attention to what is the minimum you need to share!), or mock data. The file contribution should come with a json file of the same name that contains the necessary information to run <code>phys2bids</code> on that file contribution. There is a json blueprint in OSF, you can download it and adapt it. Note that the frequency list has to be expressed in Hz as an integer or float. To contribute with a test file, open an Issue in GitHub and label it with Test. We'll help you add the file in our OSF space.

When opening a pull request, assign it at least one label.</p> <p>We encourage you to open a PR as soon as possible - even before you finish working on them. This is useful especially to you - so that you can receive comments and suggestions early on, rather than having to process a lot of comments in the final review step!

If at a later stage   you realize something is missing and it's not a minor thing, you   will need to open a new PR.</li> <li>If your contribution contains code or tests, you ran and passed all   of the tests locally with pytest.</li> <li>If you're writing documentation, you built it locally with   sphinx and the format is what you intended.</li> <li>Your code is harmonious with the rest of the code - no repetitions   of any sort!</li> </ul> <p>Your code respects the adopted Style, especially if:</p> <ul> <li>Your code is lintered adequately and respects the PEP8 convention.</li> <li>Your docstrings follow the numpydoc convention.</li> <li> <p>There are no typos or grammatical mistakes and the text is fluid.</p> </li> <li> <p>The code is sufficiently commented and the comments are clear.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your PR title is clear enough to be meaningful when appended to the version changelog.</p> </li> <li> <p>You have the correct labels.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"contributors-guide/codebase/opening-prs/#before-merging","title":"Before merging","text":"<p>To be merged, PRs have to:</p> <ol> <li>Pass all the CircleCI tests, and possibly all the codecov checks.</li> <li>Have the necessary amount of approving reviews, even if you're a    long time contributor.</li> </ol> <p>Note : You can ask one (or more) contributor to do    that review, if you think they align more with the content of your    PR. You need one review for documentation, tests, and small    changes, and two reviews for bugs, refactoring and enhancements. 3. Have at least a release-related label (or a <code>Skip    release</code> label). 4. Have a short title that clearly explains in one sentence the aim of    the PR. 5. Contain at least a unit test for your contribution, if the PR    contains code (it would be better if it contains an integration or    function test and all the breaking tests necessary). If you're not    confident about writing tests, it is possible to refer to an issue    that asks for the test to be written, or another (Draft) PR that    contains the tests required.</p> <p>As we're trying to maintain at least 90% code coverage, you're strongly encouraged to write all of the tests necessary to keep coverage above that threshold. If coverage drops too low, you might be asked to add more tests and/or your PR might be rejected. See the Automatic testing section.</p> <p>Don't merge your own pull request!

In fact, it is probably the task that requires the most time in the development, and it can be stressful for both the reviewer and the author. Remember that, as a PR Reviewer, you are guaranteeing that the changes work and integrate well with the rest of the repository, hence you are responsible for the quality of the repository and its next version release. If they don't integrate well, later PR reviewers might have to ask for broader changes than expected.</p> <p>There are many best practices to review code online, for instance this medium blog post, but here are some good rules of thumbs that we need to follow while reviewing PRs:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Be respectful to the PR authors and be clear in what you are   asking/suggesting - remember that, like you, they are contributing   their spare time and doing their best job!</p> </li> <li> <p>If there is a Draft PR, you can comment on its development in the   message board or making \"Comment\" reviews. Don't ask for changes,   and especially, don't approve the PR</p> </li> <li> <p>If the PR graduated from Draft to full PR, check that it follows the   sections Pull requests and Style Guide of these   guidelines. If not, invite the author to do so before starting a   review.</p> </li> <li>Don't limit your review to the parts that are changed. Look at   the entire file, see if the changes fit well in it, and see if the   changes are properly addressed everywhere in the code - in the   documentation, in the tests, and in other functions. Sometimes the   differences reported don't show the full impact of the PR in the   repository!</li> <li>If your want to make Pull Requests an educational process, invite   the author of the PR to make changes before actually doing them   yourself. Request changes via comments or in the message board or by   checking out the PR locally, making changes and then submitting a PR   to the author's branch.</li> <li>If you decide to use the suggestion tool in reviews, or to start a   PR to the branch under review, please alert the Project Manager.   Bots might automatically assign you contribution types that will   have to be removed (remember, your contribution in this case is   \"Reviewer\"). Instead of starting a PR to the branch under review,   think about opening a new PR with those modifications (unless they   are needed to pass tests), and alert the Main Reviewer. In any case   don't commit directly to the branch under review!</li> <li>If you're reviewing documentation, build it locally with <code>sphinx-build</code> command.</li> <li>If you're asking for changes, don't approve the PR. Approve it   only after everything was sufficiently addressed. Someone else might   merge the PR in taking your word for granted.</li> <li>If you are the main reviewer, and the last reviewer required to   approve the PR, merge the PR!</li> </ul> <p>Before approving and/or merging PRs, be sure that:</p> <ul> <li>All the tests in CircleCI/Azure pass without errors.</li> <li>Prefereably, codecov checks pass as well. If they don't, discuss   what to do.</li> <li>The title describes the content of the PR clearly enough to be   meaningful on its own - remember that it will appear in the version   changelog!</li> <li>The PR has the appropriate labels to trigger the appropriate version   release and update the contributors table.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"contributors-guide/codebase/reviewing-prs/#main-reviewer","title":"Main reviewer","text":"<p>At <code>physiopy</code> we use the Assignees section of a PR to mark the main reviewer for that PR.

In particular, we use the CircleCI platform to run automatic testing! Automatic tests are cold, robotic, emotionless, and opinionless tests that check that the program is doing what it is expected to. They are written by the developers and run (by CircleCI) every time they send a Pull Request to <code>physiopy</code> repositories. They complement the warm, human, emotional and opinionated user tests, as they tell us if a piece of code is failing. CircleCI uses pytest to run the tests. The great thing about it is that you can run it in advance on your local version of the code! We can measure the amount of code that is tested with codecov, which is an indication of how reliable our packages are! We try to maintain a 90% code coverage, and for this reason, PR should contain tests! The four main type of tests we use are:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Unit tests :</p> <pre><code>Unit tests check that a minimal piece of code is doing what it\nshould be doing. Normally this means calling a function with\nsome mock parameters and checking that the output is equal to\nthe expected output. For example, to test a function that adds\ntwo given numbers together (1 and 3), we would call the function\nwith those parameters, and check that the output is 4.\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Breaking tests</p> <pre><code>Breaking tests are what you expect - they check that the program\nis breaking when it should. This means calling a function with\nparameters that are expected **not** to work, and check that it\nraises a proper error or warning.\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Integration tests</p> <pre><code>Integration tests check that the code has an expected output,\nbeing blind to its content. This means that if the program\nshould output a new file, the file exists - even if it's empty.\nThis type of tests are normally run on real data and call the\nprogram itself. For instance, documentation PRs should check\nthat the documentation page is produced!\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Functional tests</p> <pre><code>If integration tests and unit tests could have babies, those\nwould be functional tests. In practice, this kind of tests check\nthat an output is produced, and *also* that it contains what it\nshould contain. If a function should output a new file or an\nobject, this test passes only if the file exists *and* it is\nlike we expect it to be.
