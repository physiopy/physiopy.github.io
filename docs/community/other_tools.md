# Other Tools

### Similar projects:
[PhysIO toolbox](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/physio/) that supports data processing, denoising, and modeling for the purpose of physiological denoising (depends on SPM and only runs on MATLAB, requiring a license).

PhysIO and physiopy developers have expressed interest in collaborating with each other.

### Other toolboxes with a narrower scope than physiopy’s:
- [NeuroKit](https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which offers back-end solutions for physiological data denoising.
- [AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/) and [Quantiphyse](https://quantiphyse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) offer, among other functionalities, physiological data analysis or modeling in a complementary way to physiopy.

Physiopy’s developers are in contact with the developers of these software packages to collaborate on improving between-project integration.

### Other proprietary software tools used in this field for data collection and analysis:
- [Acqknowledge](https://www.biopac.com/product/acqknowledge-software/)
- [LabChart](https://www.adinstruments.com/products/labchart)
- [Spike2](https://science-products.com/en/shop/488/21/data-aquisition/software/spike-2)

Physiopy supports most of these proprietary data formats.
