# Phys2bids
### A python3 library to format physiological files in BIDS
It was born for AcqKnowledge files (BIOPAC), and at the moment it supports `.acq` files as well as `.txt` files obtained by labchart (ADInstruments). We're also adding support for MRI-produced files, let us know if you're interested in collaborating to implement support!

### Overview
The Brain Imaging Data Standard (BIDS) is the most commonly used standard for organizing neuroimaging data. `Phys2bids` was originally developed by neuroscientists who wanted to standardize the ability to examine the relationship between physiology and brain function as there are many different data formats. Follow the links for more information on how to [install](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) and [use](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto.html) `phys2bids`, as well as the importance of [standardization to BIDS](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bids.html) format and [more](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
