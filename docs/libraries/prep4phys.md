# Prep4Phys

**Previously named Peakdet**

### A toolbox for physiological peak detection analyses

This package `prep4phys` is designed for use in the reproducible processing and analysis of physiological data, like those collected from respiratory belts, pulse photoplethysmography, or electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) monitors. For github repository, follow this [link](https://github.com/physiopy/prep4phys)

### Overview

Physiological data are messy and prone to artifact (e.g., movement in respiration and pulse, ectopic beats in ECG). Despite leaps and bounds in recent algorithms for processing these data there still exists a need for manual inspection to ensure such artifacts have been appropriately removed. Because of this manual intervention step, understanding exactly what happened to go from "raw" data to "analysis-ready" data can often be difficult or impossible.

This toolbox, `prep4phys`, aims to provide a set of tools that will work with a variety of input data to reproducibly generate manually-corrected, analysis- ready physiological data. If you'd like more information about the package, including how to install it and some example instructions on its use, check out our [documentation](https://prep4phys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Installation and User Guide

Follow this for more information on [installation and setup](https://prep4phys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) of `prep4phys` as well as ways to get involved in the development and testing of this package.

The [user guide](https://prep4phys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html) also provided at the link above discusses the reproducibility of loading and saving data, as well as, the processing and editing of the physiological data.
