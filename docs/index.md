## Who are we?
We are the physiopy development team consisting of an international group of volunteers. You can learn more about us and how to connect with us by visiting the [*Community*](/community) page. Contributions are also very much welcomed! Check out the [*Contributor Guide*](community/contributor-guide/) tab.

## What is the importance of physiological data collection and its impact on MRI?

Physiological data provides a rich representation of a research subject with respect to their bodily information (i.e., heart rate, respiratory rate and depth of breathing, skin conductance, etc.). Examining physiological activity helps us to understand the perception and embodied experience of cognition, emotion, motivation, and more. Additionaly, physiological data is a key component in understanding physiological sources of signal variance in fMRI data. Collecting these data helps to provide more accurate models of fMRI time-series. It also provides a real-time method to monitor subjects during scanning. See the [*Community Practices* documentation](https://physiopy-community-guidelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for recommendations from key personnel in the field on physiological data collection and analysis.
